# Git Emojis in every App (Thanks to [Keyboard Maestro](https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/))


Do you have the need to `:rocket:` (🚀) everywhere? Here is the solution. This is a collection of about 2600 [Keyboard Maestro](https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/) macros (You can mix and match and import single macros in the directory `macros`), if you wan't everything simply import the Macro Group and activate all macros. Then simply type any trigger-string like `:parrot:` or `:alien:` and have it replaced like magic 🧚.


If you find any 🐛s please let me know and open an issue! Thanks 🙂
